Adding a Product with all necessary details: I've set up a feature that lets us easily input new products into our inventory system. We can include all the essential details like categories, metadata, and general information such as product name, description, and price.

Searching for Products by Category, Metadata, General Details, or any combination thereof: We've implemented a powerful search function. Now, we can find products based on their category, metadata, or any other general details. This makes it a breeze to locate specific items in our inventory.

Adding products into Inventory: I've streamlined the process for adding products into our inventory. Now, whenever we get new stock, we can quickly input it into the system to keep our inventory up-to-date.

Removing products from Inventory: We've made it easy to remove products from our inventory when needed. Whether a product is out of stock or discontinued, we can swiftly remove it from our database.

Retrieving a Count of Product Inventory based on a unique product identifier or metadata on the products: I've developed a function that allows us to retrieve the count of product inventory using either a unique product identifier or metadata associated with the products. This gives us valuable insights into our inventory levels and helps us manage our stock effectively.
