Order of operations to complete project
	1. Build and test Stored Procedures to perform required CRUD operations
		Prefer ground up approach.  Data management is typically the most important part of any project, 
		therefore more time should be spent on the CRUD operations to verify the integrity of the data handling.
		Typically I prefer json input to stored procedures so that data input/output is constant (the plumbing
		doesn't change just the contents through it).

	2. Build and test API endpoints to verify database CRUD operations
		Once the stored procedures have been created and tested the next crucial aspect of any project should
		be accessing and exposing that functionality.  
	
	3. Build and test front end usage of API endpoints to verify functionality of inventory system
		Finally the front-end consideration comes into play.  How to present the data returned within the UI?
		Is this to be a web app or winforms/wpf?  Perhaps Android or iOS considerations come into play.  Maybe 
		even all of the above.  This is typically the part of the design phase where the client has more 
		opportunity for input, as well as verification that the system works per their specifications.
