* published database and named database as Inventory. 
* added Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer 3.1.32 for reverse engineering database in a new project that handles data models and context
* models added to new sparkpoint.data project. This project can be by itself a database management project and deployed to nuget package manager. This helps to add new projects and use same database for each new project without touching existing core projects. 
* Everytime database changes, you just need to run Inventory.tt file and it will catch new columns and update your project. publish to cloud of your choice, and let other projects update nuget package.
* I tried to add unit test, but there was an issue with the dll adding another main method after compiling. skipped for now. but if I were to add unit test I would test my method in the services using fake db context ef core reverse poco generated for me. 
* in launchsettings file you can uncomment the url part to change the UI.
